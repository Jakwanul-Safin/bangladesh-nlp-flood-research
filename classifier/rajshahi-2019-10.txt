Date Published:2019-10-01 00:00:00 Many people in Chapainawabganj are marooned due to the rise of water which has also destroyed 8000 hectares of cropland At least five districts in the northwestern part of the country are underwater, and has increased in the last few days as the water levels in the Padma and Mahananda have risen, touching danger level, sources said. Flood water has increased in Chapainawabganj due to torrential rains and water level in the Padma has risen by 3cm in the last 12 hours. In the Pankha point of Chapainawabganj, the water level is 27.09 cm which is just 0.41 cm lower than the danger level as recorded by the Bangladesh Water Development Board (BWDB) on Tuesday. Many people in Chapainawabganj are marooned due to the rise of water which has also destroyed 8000 hectares of cropland. The flood situation in Kushtia has worsened stranding around 50000 people. The water level at the Hardinge bridge point had crossed 10.25m yesterday, which is above danger level. In Natore, around 6000 residents in three unions of Natore's Lalpur upazila have been marooned by the floodwaters. The floods occurred due to the rise in the water level of the Padma River, where three unions - Bilamaria, Lalpur, and Iswardi, went under water, damaging 22 hectares of cropland, inflicting heavy losses on the farmers. People of the area are currently suffering from lack of drinking water and food. In Rajbari, the water level rose and was flowing 7cm above the danger level causing water to flood the city and stranding many people. In Rajshahi, the water level is just 41cm below the danger level, according to the BWDB. In Tangail, the water level in the Dhaleshwari River has risen and crossed the danger level by 7cm causing problems for people and many croplands have gone underwater. In Pabna, the water level is almost at danger level and many croplands have gone underwater. Water levels at 74 river stations, monitored by the Flood Forecasting and Warning Centre (FFWC) have seen a marked rise while 18 stations recorded a drop in levels, reports BSS. Among the 93 monitored stations, the water level at one river station has been registered steady while water levels at three river stations-the Padma at Goalundo, the Padma at Sureswar and Gorai at Kamarkhali- are flowing above the danger level, a bulletin issued by the FFWC said yesterday. All the major rivers are on a rising trend expect the Surma-Kushiyara, the bulletin said, adding that the trend of the Ganges and Padma rivers may continue rising in the next 72 hours. The reason for the floods in Bangladesh and India at the same time occurred due to torrential rains and not because the gates of the Farakka Barrage were opened, a source at the Indian High Commission in Dhaka told Dhaka Tribune adding that it was a regular practice for India to open the gates during this time of the year. AFP reported on Tuesday that the death toll in eastern India from the torrential late monsoon rains has risen to nearly 140, as hospitals and schools were inundated with dirty rainwater. The India Meteorological Department (IMD) said the current monsoon has been the heaviest since 1994, classifying it "above normal", and this year's season has been longer than usual. Over the last four days, 111 people have died in Uttar Pradesh state and a further 28 lost their lives in neighbouring Bihar, government officials told the news agency. Residents of Patna - the capital of Bihar, home to two million people - used lifeboats to escape heavily water-logged homes. Although the rains have ceased, large swathes of the city remained submerged, with schools and shops closed.

Date Published:2019-10-03 00:00:00 Swelling of the River Padma triggered by incessant rain and opening of all the floodgates at Farakka Barrage flooded several unions in Pabna on Wednesday. -- Focus Bangla photo Water in the river Padma and its tributaries on Wednesday continued to swell as upstream flow from India continued feeding the rivers in Bangladesh after India opened all the floodgates at Farakka Barrage on the Ganges on Sunday. Flood situation worsened in Kushtia and Pabna while many areas of Chapainawabganj, Rajshahi, Sirajganj, Tangail, Munshiganj, Manikganj, Magura, Faridpur, Madaripur and Shariatpur are feared to go under water. All the major rivers in Bangladesh are in rising trend except the Jamuna. The River Padma and its tributaries and the Meghna are in rising trend which may continue in the next two days, warned the Flood Forecasting and Warning Centre. Though rainfall decreased in Bangladesh on Wednesday, due to increased flow of upstream water from India, the River Padma and its tributaries continued to swell, according to the Bangladesh Met Office and FFWC. FFWC said, the Padma and Gorai rivers would likely to contribute to the worsening of the flood situation in the low-lying areas of Pabna, Kushtia, Magura, Rajbari, Manikgonj, Faridpur, Madaripur, Shariatpur and Munshiganj. Bangladesh is on the floodplains of the Himalayan rivers. Floods, once the lifeline of Bangladesh, became a source of woes due to inept water diplomacy with neighbouring India. Barrages built by India at the upstream are used to hold back water during the dry season but the floodgates are opened in the monsoon which inundate the lower riparian Bangladesh. In the last flood spanning July to August, at least 108 people died due to flood, according the Health Emergency Operation Centre and Control Room of Bangladesh. FFWC said Wednesday afternoon that Padma was flowing 13 cm above danger level at Goalanda point and 8 cm above danger level at Hardinge Bridge point. Padma's tributary Gorai is flowing above 23 cm of danger level at Kamarkhali point while another Padma's tributary Pashur at Khulna point was flowing above 35 cm of danger level. Meghna was flowing above 12 cm of danger level at Meghna Bridge point. Heavy rains caused severe flooding in India's Bihar and Uttar Pradesh in the fourth week of September killing more than a hundred people. India reportedly opened all the 109 floodgates at Farakka Barrage on Sunday, releasing 55,000 cubic meter of water toward Bangladesh every second to lessen water pressure on the barrage. Indian Met Office predicted that rain would lessen in the coming days. Bangladesh Met Office said at 6pm Wednesday that in past 24 hours, major rainfall were recorded at 85 mm in Khepupara of Barishal, 88 mm in Khulna, 22 mm at Kumarkhali in Kushtia, 30 mm at Tarash in Rajshahi and 36 mm in Sylhet. Met Office said in next 24 hours from 6:00pm Wednesday, light to moderate rain or thunder showers accompanied by temporary gusty wind is likely to occur at many places over Khulna, Barishal, Chattogram and Sylhet divisions and at a few places over Rangpur, Rajshahi, Mymensingh and Dhaka divisions with moderately heavy to heavy rainfalls at places over Khulna, Barishal Chattogram and Sylhet divisions. Met Office said the axis of monsoon runs through India's Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Bihar, West Bengal and Assam and across central part of Bangladesh. New Age correspondent in Kushtia reported that the flood situation in Kumarkhali and Daulatpur in the district worsens on Wednesday as Padma continued overflowing. About 5 meters of Kuthi Bari Barrage collapsed due to the rise and intense flow of water. Several villages were marooned due the flooding. Around 50,000 people of four unions under Daulatpur upazila have been inundated. Villagers on the river bank are taking shelter at the flood control embankment and other dry places and some took shelter at their relatives' homes. Shilaidah Union Parishad chairman Salauddin Khan told New Age that the situation would worsen if the water continued to swell. New Age correspondent in Pabna reported that rise of water massively damaged the winter crop cultivation in six out of nine upazilas in Pabna. The water from Padma affected Pabna Sadar, Ishwardi and Sujanagar upazila in the last two days. The rise of water level may continue for the next two or three days, said Mosharaf Hossain, assistant director of Pabna water development board. Azahar Ali, deputy director of Pabna Agriculture Extension Department, said the floodwater massively damaged the winter crop in the last couple of days. Around 12,500 hectors of land was inundated, causing serious damage to winter vegetables and lentils. Six thousand farmers in six upazilas of the district incurred huge losses, Azhar said. If the water level continued to increase more areas would be affected, damaging massive portion of the winter crops in the district, he said. In Chapainawabganj, at least 10,000 people were stranded in parts of the Sadar and Shibganj upazilas on Wednesday as the water level of the Padma and Mahananda rivers increased further, reported UNB. Low-lying areas, including crop fields, and a number of houses have been flooded, locals said. More about: @#@#

Date Published:2019-10-01 00:00:00 About 55,000 cubic meters of water gushed out of the Farakka Barrage every second and flowed into Bangladesh since India opened all 109 floodgates at the barrage on Sunday night. The Times of India reported that flood turned so intense in Patna-Danapur that even after all the floodgates were opened at the Farakka Barrage on Monday it did not bring much relief to the people. The Water Development Board officials however avoided answering questions raised about India opening the floodgates by saying that the gates usually stayed open during the monsoon. On September 23, the Farakka Barrage authorities opened 55 floodgates after Bihar CM Nitish Kumar requested the central government to discharge water through Farakka Barrage as floodwaters engulfed Patna and 12 other districts. The floods already killed 48 people, including 13 in Bihar. The Flood Forecasting and Warning Centre Sunday said that heavy rains in the second, third and fourth week of September could trigger floods in Bangladesh by October 2. The FFWC said that 13 rivers in northern, north-western and central Bangladesh may get inundated as the Ganges and Gorai rivers were likely to swell up. Though, there was no report of inundation from any district. New Age correspondent at Rajshahi University reported quoting WDB's Rajshahi office that the Ganges swelled 11 cm in 12 hours until 6:00pm Monday. The FFWC said on Monday morning that the River Ganges might continue to swell over the next three days. The FFWC recorded country's highest rainfall of 68 mm at Rohanpur in 24 hours until Monday morning. It rained 93 mm in Bhagalpur and 92 mm in Patna during the same time, reported the FFWC. Given the opening of the floodgates, it seems the country is at the brink of facing a second major flood in the gap of about two months. The first flood was caused after India opened Gajaladoba Barrage floodgates in July. The first spell, which lasted up to three weeks at places in 28 districts, wreaked havoc in rural Bangladesh, destroying crops, damaging houses and other properties, embankments and washing away fisheries. The affected areas were in northern, north-eastern, central and south-eastern Bangladesh. The Met Office said that monsoon was fairly active over Bangladesh and predicted rains at most places over six divisions including Dhaka. It also said that heavy rain is likely to occur at many places over Khulna and Rajshahi divisions. The Met Office recorded country's highest rainfall of 111 mm in 24 hours until 6:00pm on Monday at Rajshahi. More about: @#@#

Date Published:2019-10-02 00:00:00 The swelling Padma has flooded vast areas of Rajshahi, Pabna and Chapainawabganj following onrush of water from the river's Indian upstream and incessant rain for the last couple of days. Our staff correspondent from Rajshahi reports: At least 15,692 people were affected by the flood in Paba, Godagari and Bagha upazilas, said officials at the district administration. Some 600 families were shifted to safe places in the city, at least 11 educational institutions in Bagha upazila were shut and crops on 102 hectares of land were damaged due to the flood, they said. In last one week, hundreds of people from low lying char areas took shelter at their relatives' houses and different slums in the city. "The flood followed downpour in the upstream of the Padma, which triggered extra flow of water from Indian Bihar state. All gates of the Farakka Barrage in India remained open since beginning of the monsoon," said Mohammad Ali, chief engineer of Water Development Board's (WDB) Rajshahi zonal office. "We are keeping watch on the water level, which was only 41 centimetres below the danger level this [Tuesday] afternoon. The river will continue to rise until the flood situation in India improves," said the official. Aminul Haque, district relief and rehabilitation officer, said they distributed 50 tonnes of food grain and 900 packets of dry food among the affected people. Visiting the Padma bank yesterday, this correspondent saw people from the char areas coming to Rajshahi city with their domestic animals and other belongings in boats. Sazedur Rahman, a boatman, said he has two homes - one in Rajshahi city, and the other at Char Khanpur where some 200 families like him live. Most of the families have shifted to the city as a large portion of the char went under water. "Some 365 families of Char Khanpur and Madhya Char were affected. Most people have shifted to the city, but some are still staying on high lands," said Mofidul Islam Bachchu, chairman of Harian union parishad in Paba. Our Pabna Correspondent reports: The onrush of water from the upstream in the Padma caused flash floods in many low lying areas of Pabna Sadar, Ishwardi and Sujanagar upazilas in last 24 hours as the river is flowing above the danger level. "The river was flowing two centimetre above the danger level at Hardinge Bridge point this [Tuesday] morning. The water level may increase next few days due to the onrush of water from the upstream and continuous rain," Johurul Haque, executive engineer of WDB, told the journalists after visiting the Padma. Hundreds of houses in Pabna Sadar, Ishwardi and Sujanagar upazilas went under water due to the sudden rise of water level in the Padma. "The floodwater entered our houses and crop fields so rapidly that we could not save anything," said Md Belal Hossain of Char Sanikdiar village in Pabna Sadar upazila. Md Sirajul Islam, district relief and rehabilitation officer, said, "The water level is increasing and district administration is prepared to take necessary steps. The recent rise of water level caused massive damaged to crops. We are collecting information of damage." Our Chapainawabganj Correspondent adds: The Padma was flowing 41 centimetres below the danger level at Pankha point of Shibganj upazila in Chapainawabganj yesterday morning, said Atikur Rahman, sub-divisional engineer of Chapainawabganj Water Development Board. A few villages in the low areas of Panka union in Shibganj upazila and Narayanpur union in Sadar upazila were flooded due to the rise in water, he said. The Padma enters Bangladesh from India through Pankha point of Shibganj. @#

Date Published:2019-10-01 00:00:00 "The Indian part of Farakka barrage doesn't have any contribution in the flood situation," Md Arifuzzaman Bhuiyan, executive engineer in Flood Forecasting and Warning Centre of the board, said on Tuesday. India on Monday opened all of the 119 gates of the Farakka barrage across the Ganges river due to floods in Uttar Pradesh and Bihar caused by heavy rains. Bhuiyan said: "The opening of gates by India this season is a regular phenomenon." Continuous downpour and rising water level in the upstream may bring floods to Rajshahi, Chapainawabganj, Kushtia and Natore in the Padma basin, BWDB engineers said earlier. The flood situation may worsen as India has already opened the gates, the media reported. The water level rose for all major rivers. The Padma River was flowing 7 cm above the danger level at Goalanda point. The Garai River was flowing 5 cm above the danger level at Kamarkhali point in Kushtia. Rivers in the Ganges-Padma basin will continue to swell for the next 72 hours and the water level at Hardinge Bridge and Bhagyakul point may cross the danger level, BWDB forecast. The floods in July were caused by heavy rain and the country is experiencing the same situation now due to downpour, Bhuiyan said. "One part of the barrage was already open. Now the flow of water entering the country is caused by rain," Bhuiyan said. "It is natural that the water will pass through the rivers in our country as we are situated downstream. The water will recede through the middle part of the country. There's nothing to panic." @#@#

Date Published:2019-10-03 00:00:00 Fresh areas of Rajshahi, Pabna and Chapainawabganj went under water yesterday as the mighty Padma continued to swell. The flooding caused massive damage to early winter crops in Pabna, reports our correspondent. Fresh areas of Pabna Sadar, Ishwardi and Sujanagar upazilas went under water in last two days, said officials of the Water Development Board (WDB). "The Padma is flowing 7 centimetres above the danger level at Pakshey Hardinge Bridge point as the water level has risen by five centimetres in last 24 hours. The rise may continue next two or three days," Md Mosharaf Hossain, assistant director of Pabna WDB, told The Daily Star. However, no massive flood is expected as the water level in the Jamuna remains normal, he added. Md Azahar Ali, deputy director of the Department of Agriculture Extension (DAE) in Pabna, said the ongoing floods caused serious damage to early winter crops. "Over 12 thousand hectares of land beside the Padma have been brought under cultivation of early winter vegetables and pulses but the crops on 1730 hectares have already gone under water. "Approximately 27,500 tonnes of early winter crops worth Tk 7 crore have been damaged, affecting 6,000 farmers in six upazilas of the district. If the water level continues to rise for two or three more days, the damage will be immense," the official said. Md Abdullah, a flood affected farmer of Char Sanikdiar village, said, "The sudden flood damaged bean on my five bighas of land. Now I am living on an embankment as the floodwater also entered my house." Md Sirajul Islam, the district's relief and rehabilitation officer, said they are making lists of flood-affected people for conducting relief work. Our Rajshahi Staff Correspondent reports: The WDB yesterday identified at least six points of Rajshahi City Protection Embankment as risky due to strong current of the swelling Padma.

This photo was taken on Tuesday. -- New Age photo At least 350 homesteads and 500 hectares of crop land in Daulatdia and Debagram union in Goalunda of Rajbari were devoured by the River Padma in past few days. The locals alleged that no effective measures were yet to be taken to check the erosion. The Bangladesh Inland Water Transport Authority could not reinstall two landing station at the Daulatdia ferry point in past six days brining to respite to disruption on ferry services on Paturia-Daulatdia route. Ferry services on Paturia-Daulatdia route continue to disrupt because of strong current in the river, damage of landing station and shortage of ferries. Daulatdia ferry and launch terminals were threatened by massive erosion of the river Padma and two of the terminals were washed away on Thursday. A 100-feet approach road of Daulatdia ferry terminals eroded into the river and half-kilometer road between Daulatdia ferry terminal and Akkas Ali High School were also on erosion risk. Terminals 3, 4, 5 and 6 at Daulatdia were now under serious threat of erosion, said Zillur Rahman, deputy general manager of Bangladesh Inland Water Transport Corporation at Aricha regional office. 'Strong current is hitting directly Daulatdia ferry terminals due to erosion at Dhalla Para. At the same time, various establishments including mosques and madrassahs are alson on erosion risk,' said Abdul Goni, chairman of Daulatdia union parishad. Residents in the area said the rate of erosion increased with the increase of flood water for the second time. In last two months, more than 100 families at Dhalla Para and about 200 families of Siddik Kazir Para and 50 families of Debagrame moved to other places as their homesteads eroded into the river, they said. At last 400 hectare of crop land was wash away in Debagrame. Kabir Sarder of Dhalla Para said the erosion of was so severe that it took very little time to get the homesteads eroded in the river. 'Many people are shifting their houses as per their ability. But many others become homeless as could not afford to shift their homesteads,' he said. One Wahab Mondol said around 200 families of Hatem Mondoler Para were under serious threat of erosion. At least 300 homesteads of Kachari Danga, Kiamuddin Mandal Para, Bhuti Para, Nehari Mandal Para and Isail Shibrampur eroded in last year. Most of those victims took shelter to in Ward 1 and 5 but they again facing threat of erosion. Goalunda upazila nirbahi officer Rubaet Hayat Shiplu said, 'Daulatdia ferry and launch terminals would be threatened if the erosion continues.

Date Published:2019-10-01 00:12:55 The water level of the Padma River has risen sharply due to the continuous rainfall across the Ganges basin area and discharge of huge water through the Farakka Barrage, raising alarm for floods in the north-western region of the country. The water level of the Padma River was recorded at 17.98 metres in Rajshahi yesterday, just 0.52 metres shy of the danger mark. Reports in the Indian media said all 119 gates of Farakka Barrage have been opened to avoid flooding in the adjacent areas. All gates of the dam were opened due to massive water-logging and risk of flooding in 12 districts in the Indian State of Bihar, including Patna, said reports. "The Centre acted timely by opening all 119 gates of the Farakka barrage to ensure speedy discharge of the river water," said a Times of India report yesterday. Rising Padma water has inundated low lying areas and vegetable farms in 18 char lands under three unions in Lalpur Upazila of Natore. Ishwardi Sugarcane Factory sources said flood submerged sugarcanes on 42 acres land. Ummul Banin Duti, Upazila Nirbahi Officer of Lalpur said early variety winter vegetable fields in 18 char lands under Ishwardi, Bilmaria and Sadar unions in the upazila have gone under floodwater. Al Asad, assistant engineer of Natore Water Development Board, said if water level continues to rise further the water level in the Padma River will cross the danger mark soon. Talking to The Independent, Mohammad Ali, Chief Engineer of Water Development Board, Rajshahi informed that due to heavy rainfall across Bihar and Uttar Prodesh in India, most of the gates of Farakka Barrage have been opened up causing a sharp rise in the Padma water level. The Rajshahi city was paralysed yesterday due to incessant rain. The rainfall began at 4:30 am and continued without break till the writing of this report at 7:00 pm.

Date Published:2019-10-02 00:00:00 Water was flowing above the danger level at six points in the country on Wednesday due to heavy rains and onrush from the upstream, according to the board' Flood Forecasting and Warning Centre. Water may continue to rise for two more days, the centre's Executive Engineer Md Arifuzzaman told bdnews24.com. As a result, the flood situation in the low-lying lands of the districts next to the Ganges, the Padma and the Gorai rivers may worsen, he said. The districts are Pabna, Kushtia, Magura, Rajbari, Manikganj, Faridpur, Madaripur, Shariatpur, and Munshiganj, according to Arifuzzaman. Water of the Brahmaputra, the Jamuna, the Surma and the Kushiara may recede in the next 48 hours, he said. Water was rising at 56 of the 93 points under the centre's observation. In India's Cherapunji, rainfall of 90 millimetres was recorded in the 24 hours to 9am on Wednesday. In Bangladesh, the WDB recorded up to 245mm rains in Sunamganj. The water of the rivers in Bangladesh started to rise by the end of September due to heavy rains. Meanwhile, India has opened the Farakka Barrage to let the water flow away. Some places in Chanpainawabganj, Rajshahi, Natore, Pabna, Kushtia, Rajbari and Magura were hit by short-term foods afterwards. Engineer Arifuzzaman said the situation will improve by the end of the week with the drop in rainfall.

The water level at Bheramara Hardinge Bridge point was flowing 5cm over the danger level and in the last 12 hours the level of water increased by 2cm breaking all the previous records. The floods had caused at least 50,000 people to be stranded. In Tangail, though water in the Jamuna River receded, levels of water in the other rivers increased. Water level in the Dhaleshwari River increased by 5cm causing the water to flow 22cm above the danger level, while the water level of the Jhinai River increased by 1cm resulting the water to flow 62cm over the danger level. The increase in water level had submerged the low lying lands, rendering countless numbers of families homeless. In Pabna, water level of the Padma at the Paksi Hardinge Bridge point increased by 7cm which caused the water to flow 14.25 cm above the danger level breaking the record of the last 16 years. Considering the flood emergency, leave of public servants of three upazilas including Upazila Nirbahi Officers (UNO) were cancelled, said Deputy Commissioner Kabir Mahmud at a press briefing on Wednesday evening. "All concerning district officials are on duty due to the sudden upheaval of the water-level in the recent floods, which exceeded the danger mark," the commissioner added. In Natore, the water level of the river had increased causing thousands of people to be stranded. At Rajshahi's Charghat point the water level of the Padma River increased by 5cm resulting the water to flow 85cm below the danger level. At Shingra point the water level of the Akrai River increased by 10cm and at Naldanga Upazila the water level of the Barnoi River also increased by 10cm. 10,000 people stranded as Padma, Mahananda water level rises At least 10,000 people were stranded in parts of Sadar and Shibganj upazilas on Wednesday as the water level of the Padma and Mahananda rivers increased further. Low-lying areas, including crop fields, and a number of houses have been flooded, locals said, reports UNB. Bihar minister: Farakka Barrage must be dismantled Sanjay Kumar Jha, eastern India's state of Bihar's water resources minister on Tuesday said that Farakka Barrage, which was been built compromising the state's interest, should be dismantled. According to the Times of India, the minister said the state government has been writing to the federal government for the resolution of the problems caused by the dam and will do so again encompassing all issues. The Farakka Barrage was constructed in the early 60s with the main purpose of helping flush out sediment deposition from the Kolkata Port, besides addressing drinking water requirement in West Bengal. The dam became operational in 1975. "It (Farakka Barrage) must be dismantled in the interest of Bihar...People of Bihar have been suffering every year due to it. It has become 'misery' for all of us," Jha told reporters. More than 1,600 die in India's heaviest monsoon season for 25 years The heaviest monsoon rains to lash India in 25 years have killed more than 1,600 people since June, government data showed on Tuesday, as authorities battled floods in two northern states and muddy waters swirled inside a major city, reports Reuters.

Date Published:2019-10-02 00:16:05 Water levels at various points have crossed the danger mark after India opened all the gates of the Farakka barrage following devastating floods in Bihar. Many new areas in 12 districts have been inundated by flood waters in north and northwestern regions of the country. According to the Flood Forecasting Warning Centre (FFWC), the Padma river is flowing over the danger level at the Hardinge point, Goalundo and Sureswar, while the Gorai river is flowing above the Kamarkhali point. However, the Rajshahi district administration has already started shifting people from char and low-lying areas to different flood shelters fearing another spell of flood. The disaster management and relief ministry has allocated dry food and cash taka for all flood-affected districts. According to the Bangladesh Water Development Board (WDB), large chunks of Rajshahi, Natore, Chapainawabganj, Kushtia, Pabna, Rajbari, Manikganj, Faridpur, Madaripur, Shariatpur and Munshiganj districts may go under floodwater. Waters of the Ganges and Padma rivers are rising and may continue to rise in the next 72 hours, Arifuzamman Bhuiyan, executive engineer of FFWC, told this correspondent yesterday. "We have recorded a rise in the water level at 74 points in the last 24 hours," he said in reply to a query. Waters of all the major rivers are rising, except the Surma-Kushiyara, and will cross their respective danger marks in the next 24 hours, he warned. The Padma and Mahananda rivers continued to swell in Natore and Chapainawabganj districts, respectively, while water level of the Padma crossed the danger level at Hardinge Point in Natore yesterday afternoon. The water was flowing 45cm below the red mark at Charghat point yesterday morning. Meanwhile, 18 chars under three unions of Lalpur upazila in Natore have already gone under water, rendering about 3,000 families homeless. New areas were inundated in Chapainawabganj as the water level of the Padma and Mahananda continued to rise. In Kushtia, the Padma is flowing above the danger level at the Hardinge Bridge point. Thousands of people in low-lying areas of Daulatpur upazila have become marooned. The Gorai has also corossed the danger mark at the Kamarkhali point. Owing to the increase in water, several areas of Ramkrishnapur, Chilmari, Phillipnagar and Maricha Union of Daulatpur upazila of Kushtia have been inundated. Besides, river banks are being eroded in Komarkandi village of Shilaidah union of Kumarkhali upazila. The swelling Gorai river has flooded several houses along the embankment of the Boro Bazar area, including the GK ghat. Many left their homes and took shelter in high areas. The water level was 2cm above the danger level at 10am, said WDB executive engineer Pijush Krishna Kundu/ "We have already allocated relief materials for three districts--Rajshahi, Shariatpur and Kushtia. The ministry has allocated 3,000 packets of dry food for Kushtia and 500 packets for Rajshahi," Nurul Basir, deputy secretary of the disaster management and relief ministry, told The Independent yesterday. He said relief materials were already stocked in several districts. "Additional allocation is likely to start from today (Wednesday) as per demand of the local administration. We have all-out preparation to face the flood," he added. Opening of 109 gates of the Farakka barrage is part of regular management of water, said WDB director Munshi Enamul Huq. All the departments concerned are kept alert to face any possible flood, and precautionary measures have already been taken up, he added. Local administrations have already been informed regarding any possible flood in the country, he said. Our correspondent from Rajshahi: Several thousand marooned villagers of char areas have taken shelter with their belongings and cattle on the Padma river embankment due to erosion and flooding in low-lying areas of Bagha, Charghat, Godagari and Paba upazilas in the district. The Bagha upazila administration has suspended classes at 11 schools in char areas until the situation becomes normal. Embankments along the Padma surrounding Rajshahi city are also under the threat of erosion as the water continues to swell. Mohammad Ali, chief engineer of the Rajshahi Water Development Board, said the rate of water rising was less yesterday than on Monday. But it is difficult to predict whether the water would cross the danger level. "But there is no chance to cross the previous record of 2013," he added. Golam Sabbir Satter Tapu, professor of the geology and mining department of Rajshahi University, said opening of all gates of the Farakka barrage by India without considering the situation in Bangladesh and without informing anyone was a clear violation of international law and bilateral agreement signed between the two countries. UNB adds: The Daulatdia ferry and launch ghats, the gateway to the country's south-western region, have been threatened by massive erosion of the Padma. Various establishments, including educational institutions and madrasas, were threatened by largescale erosion on the banks of the Padma in Daulatdia and Debogram unions of Goalanda upazila under Rajbari. Homesteads of about 200 families of three villages of Daulatdia have already been devoured. "However, locals alleged that no effective measures have been taken yet to check the erosion," he added. After visiting the erosion area, Rubaet Hayat Shiplu, upazila nirbahi officer, said that the Daulatdia ferry and launch ghat would be threatened if the erosion continued. "The local lawmaker and the Rajbari WDB have been informed about the situation. The upazila administration has been asked to take necessary action in this regard," he added. MK @#@#

The Padma and Mahananda rivers continued to swell in Natore and Chapainawabganj districts after India opened all the gates of the Farakka barrage following flood in Patna and 12 other districts, inundating new areas. The water level of the Padma almost touched the danger level at Hardinge point in Natore on Tuesday morning. The water was flowing 45cm below the red mark at Charghat point.  Meanwhile, the swelling water submerged 18 chars under three unions of Lalpur upazila in the district, rendering about 3,000 families homeless. New areas were inundated in Chapainawabganj as the water level of the Padma and Mahananga continued to rise. Sources at the local office of Bangladesh Water Development Board said the Padma water level rose by 15cm while that of Mahananda by 24cm in the last 24 hours till Tuesday morning. However, both the rivers are still flowing below the danger level. They were flowing 41cm and 34cm below the red mark respectively in the morning. According to the Times of India, the Centre opened all the gates following a request from Pataliputra MP Ravi Shankar Prasad. Ravi Shankar Prasad contacted Union minister for water resources and urged him to ensure that 119 gates of the Farakka barrage were raised to prevent floods in Patna and 12 other districts, sources close to Prasad said, adding the Union minister would reach Patna on Monday night.

Vehicles get stuck in a long tailback near Shimulia ferry terminal in Munshiganj on Tuesday as mighty currents in the River Padma hampered ferry service. -- New Age photo Road links between the capital and 21 southern and 17 south-western districts remained virtually snapped as strong currents in the Padma caused disruptions in the ferry services across river. All ferry services between the Shimulia Ghat and the Kathalbari Ghat  were suspended since Monday night. The ferry services between the Paturia Ghat and the Daulatdia Ghats became infrequent for the last eight days since the Padma devoured a huge chunk of the Daulatdia Ghat. At around 8:30 pm, Monday, Bangladesh Inland Water Transport Corporation indefinitely suspended the ferry service between Shimulia Ghat and the Kathalbar Ghat, reported New Age correspondent at Munshiganj. BIWTC manager at Shimulia Ghat Abdul Alim said that three ferries had been kept standby since Tuesday morning only to transport ambulances across the Padma and attend to other emergency services. A total of 16 ferries operate between the two  ghats. Shimulia Ghat's traffic-in-charge Helal Uddin told New Age that over 700 vehicles were stuck at Shimulia Ghat in a tailback stretching several kms until Tuesday afternoon. New Age correspondent in Manikganj reported that hundreds of vehicles were stranded on the two sides of the Padma, since the ferry services between Paturia Ghat and the Daulatdia Ghat became infrequent. The two ghats provide the only connectivity between the capital and 17 south-western districts by road. The aged ferries find it very difficult to navigate through the Padma's strong currents. The Padma has been in spate since India opened floodgates of its Farakka Barrage inundating vast areas in half a dozen districts and now it's eroding its banks on several bends. New Age correspondent in Pabna reported that floods marooned 6,495 families in three upazilas compelling many of them to leave their homes. Floods also caused massive damage to early winter  vegetables and other crops in Pabna, one of the major vegetable suppliers to the nation. Al Amin, a farmer of Shakin Tia, Ishwardy Sadar, saw his crops on 4.5 bighas rotting submerged by the floods. 'I have been reduced to a beggar,' Al Amin told New Age. The marooned complained about inadequate and discriminatory relief distributions. Pabna deputy commission Kabir Mahmood said that there was no dearth in relief distributions to the needy. So far the district administration said that it distributed 1,415 packets of relief materials, each containing 16.5 kgs of rice, lentil, cooking oil, sugar and other essentials. New Age correspondent in Lalmonirhat reported that the Teesta and the Dharla devoured 153 homes in last 24 hours. India opened all the floodgates at Gajaldoba barrage five days ago and villagers in 16 unions in four upazilas in the northern districts were marooned. Mosaddek Hossain, chairman, Moheshkhocha union parishad, Aditmari, said that floods displaced at least 200 families in his constituency. It is for the 2nd time that devastating floods struck the area since July. The Flood Forecasting and Warning Centre said Tuesday morning that the major rivers would continue to recede over next three days. More about:

Long tailback of vehicles creates at Paturia ferry point as ferry services disrupted on Paturia-Daulatdia route due to strong current on river Padma on Saturday. -- New Age photo The authorities diverted traffic on the Dhaka-Aricha Highway since Saturday as heavy currents in the Padma River hampered ferry services between Paturia and the Daulatdia ghats. The Padma is flowing above its danger mark at several points for the sixth consecutive day  eroding its banks at different bends as India continued to discharge the flood flows through the Farakka Barrage. According to government estimates the Padma devoured the homes of at least 6,256 families in Rajshahi and Shariatpur. The families evacuated themselves on embankments under the open skies or at  relatives' homes. On September 29, India opened the floodgates of the Farakka Barrage. Marooned villagers said that the government was downplaying the losses caused by erosion by the Padma, the Meghna and the Gorai. Erosion is playing havoc also in Rajbari, Kushtia and Lakashimpur districts. New Age correspondent in Manikganj reported that the district police diverted traffic from the Dhaka Aricha Highway. The police took the move  after at least 500 vehicles remained stuck at the Paturia Ghat waiting to cross the mighty Padma. The Bangladesh Inland Water Transport Corporation said that three out of its six jetties have to be relocated as erosion had devoured these points at Daulatdia. The BIWTC advised travellers to detour using the Jamuna Bridge. The Paturia and the Daulatdia ghats are used by millions of people while travelling either way between the capital and 17 south-western districts and also for the transportation of goods by road. BIWTC assistant general manager Zillur Rahman told New Age that due to strong currents in the Padma 13 out of 16 ferries were unable to sail between the two key ghats across the Padma. He said that the erosion wreaked havoc  at the Daulatdia ghat for the last six days. BIWTC's Daulatdia station manager Abu Abdullah said that the remaining jetties also could get unusable anytime due to the Padma eroding its bank. Bangladesh Inland Water Transport Authority deputy director Faridul Islam said that operations of small mechanised boats had been  suspended indefinitely. Mmechanised boats carry hundreds of people across the Padma between  Paturia and the Daulatdia ghats every day. The disaster management and relief ministry said that about 30,000 families had been  marooned by floods in Rajshahi, Kushtia, Rajbari and Shariatpur districts. New Age correspondent at Islamic University reported that 50,000 people have been marooned by floods in Kushtia. He said that the maroon people are in panic of snake bite. The floods also damaged many schools, mosques and other establishments. Standing winter vegetables have been damaged in six northern and central districts. New Age correspondent in Bogura reported that vegetable fields in seven unions were badly damaged by floods caused by the overflowing Jamuna River. The Flood Forecasting and Warning Centre said that the Padma began to recede Saturday morning and it might continue for the next 48 hours. The Padma and the Gorai were flowing above the danger marks at Hardinge Bridge, Goalondo and the Kamarkhali River Gauging Stations. This is for the second time since July that major floods hit Bangladesh. In July over six million people in 28 districts were marooned by floods that occurred after  India opened the floodgates of its Gajaldoba Barrage. More about:

Not a single family, who became homeless for sudden floods and river erosion over the last week, turned up at the government opened shelters knowing that it might be quite a while for them to return home. Many of them lost their houses and every last pieces of tangible property to erosion while others suffered losses partly.  All of them had to leave houses anyway as the Padma and the Gorai flowed above the danger mark at three places until Friday. The government estimates and media reports showed floods since Sunday marooned about 30,000 families in Rajshahi, Kushtia, Pabna, Shariatpur, Rajbari and Faridpur with about a thousand of them losing houses to erosion. 'Though our shelter centres are ready, there was none to seek shelter,' Rajbari deputy commissioner Dilsad Begum told New Age. She said that about 4,000 families in four upazilas were marooned by floods and 200 families had their homes lost to the Padma because of erosion. She said people perhaps had gone to their relatives or elsewhere looking for shelter. Anisur Rahman Sharif, Lakkhikunda union parishad chairman, in Ishwardi of Pabna, said people did not feel comfortable going to government shelters because of their lack of confidence in getting a respectful treatment there. 'These poor men are used to managing on their own and relying least on the government,' he said. Layeb Uddin, chairman, Bagha upazila in Rajshahi, said people prefer to cling to their property and home as long as they could but when they had to leave homestead, they preferred staying close to it. Shelters centres were not very common in the areas currently experiencing flooding but in areas where floods happen frequently people were similarly unwilling to go to shelter centres because of their poor management. A Transparency International Bangladesh report studying July flooding of northern and north-eastern districts said that 86 per cent shelter centres in the affected areas did not have enough food supplies. The shelter centres were so poorly managed that in 41 per cent of them had no toilet, revealed the TIB report. As high as 82 per cent of the studied shelter centres did not have supplies of oral saline or any medicine, the report said. About 76 per cent of families studied for preparing the TIB report complained about the government having no arrangement for bringing them to shelter centres. The TIB report said the shelter centres were not enough to meet basic demand of people, let alone having facilities to take care of livestock that people like to take along while moving to safety. Only seven per cent of the studied people sought shelter in government shelter centres in July flood that marooned over 6 million people in 28 districts, the TIB report said. Rajshahi deputy commissioner Hamidul Haque told New Age on Friday that about 56 families lost their houses in Charghat but none of them were willing to avail government shelter facilities. Hamidul said these families might need to wait a while to get hold of fresh land to build new homes but still they were not willing to come to government shelters. He claimed to have distributed Tk 6 lakh among the families who moved to places unknown to the district administration at the moment. 'They may have gone to their relatives,' said Hamidul. Floods marooned 4,000 families in low lying areas in four upazilas of Rajshahi, he said. New Age correspondent in Pabna reported that about 12,000 people were marooned by floods in 12 upazilas with at least 600 of them forced to leave their houses. But none of the families went to government shelter centres, he said. Faridpur deputy commissioner Atul Sarker said that about 2,000 families were marooned in low lying areas in three upazilas but none was taken to shelter centres. Generally the government turn local school or colleges as shelter centres. In the coastal regions, schools were specially designed for accommodating people during cyclones. Although shelter centres were supposed to have raised ground in its vicinity for accommodating livestock supplies brought along by affected families, the facility often remain unavailable at shelters. Disaster experts also criticise about improper distribution of government shelter centres, far away from most disaster prone places, requiring people to cover long distances on foot amid rough weather conditions to reach there. New Age correspondent in Manikganj reported strong current on River Padma lengthened travelling time for ferries carrying vehicles across the river, leading to congestion tailing back four kilometres at Paturia point. Bangladesh Inland Water Transport Corporation manager Zillur Rahman said that about 700 vehicles were stranded on both sides of the river until 6:00pm Friday. The Flood Forecasting and Warning Centre predicted flood waters might start receding from Saturday morning. The FFWC said that the Padma and the Gorai were flowing above the danger mark at Hardinge Bridge, Goalonda and Kamarkhali points until Friday morning. It was the second major flood since July caused by opening of floodgates of Farakka Barrage in India. Days of incessant rain caused flooding in Indian states of Uttar Pradesh and Bihar in late September. The July flood was also caused after India opened floodgates at Gajaldoba following incessant rains. The FFWC said rainfall decreased in the upstream over the past few days which would continue in the coming days. The FFWC said 86mm rainfall was recorded in 24 hours until Friday morning at Shilchar in India. Bangladesh Meteorological Department predicted a sustained decrease in rainfall over the next few days.
